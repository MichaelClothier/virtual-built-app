  <p>“It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.” Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
  <h3>BIM Managment just got easy!</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>When constructing a project, nothing is more critical than knowing exactly what's going on around you, when using Digital Information, Data Analytics is the key.</p>
  <p>Construction projects are complex, with many elements to be coordinated and built, and many stakeholders to organised and managed. There's no single repository of BIM data, and no single source of truth.</p>
  <p>Virtual Built App is Project Intelligence Framework that provides the insight when you need it. By analysing the available project BIM Data, health and performance can be measured, key truths established, and informed decisions made.</p>

  <strong>What we already know about Data</strong>
  <p>“Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, and wandering around in the middle of a freeway.” – Geoffrey Moore</p>
  <p>“With data collection, ‘the sooner the better’ is always the best answer.” – Marissa Mayer</p>
  <p>“Without a systematic way to start and keep data clean, bad data will happen.” — Donato Diorio</p>
